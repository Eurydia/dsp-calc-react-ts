For all intents and purposes, this project is complete. I have implemented every little things I have set out to do with this project. But I will continue to add  small improvements to it from time to time.

## Background

I played DSP a lot during the Covid-19 pandemic. When I look back, I think I might have enjoyed it a little too much because after each session, my fingers were sore from clicking. My inefficient playstyle made me click excessively, so came up with the idea for this calculator.

The core idea of the calculator revolves around the concept of arrays. Briefly put, an array in this instance refers to the maximal number of facilities placed along one line of belt. After setting the parameters, the calculator would suggest an optimal layout.
