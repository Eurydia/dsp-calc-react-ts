# DSP Production Calculator

## Description

In this project, I tried to solve a problem I had during my playthrough.
I noticed that when I overpopulated an array of Assembling Machines, machines towards the end would not receive enough materials.
The calculator determines the maximum number of facilities that can be placed together in one long array.
