# DSP Production Calculator

## Synopsis

In this project, I try to solve a problem I had during my playthrough of Dyson Sphere Program.

Namely, when I placed multiple facilities along one line of belt, the facilities toward the end of line would stop working as they did not receive  enough items.

The calculator helps determine the maximum number of facilities that can be placed along one long array.
